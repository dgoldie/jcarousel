jCarousel - Riding carousels with jQuery

jCarousel is a jQuery plugin for controlling a list of items in horizontal or vertical order. 
The items, which can be static HTML content or loaded with (or without) AJAX, can be scrolled 
back and forth (with or without animation).

See index.html for documentation and examples.


Forked by Doug Goldie.

Added insert() method to jcarousel with an example.
You can insert a new element before or after any existing element.
